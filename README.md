# Receipt-Generator

This program is a simple shopping cart tool where users can add items, input their prices, and receive a final receipt showing all items purchased and the total cost. The user continues adding items until they choose to quit, at which point the receipt is generated, displaying the list of items and the total amount spent. It offers an easy way to track purchases and calculate the total cost of a shopping trip.
